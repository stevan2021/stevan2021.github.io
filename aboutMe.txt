My name is Stevan Stajkovic and I'm a graduate of University of Belgrade.
I've been writing JavaScript for many years, moving from building web apps with jQuery to React/Vue. 
Today I mainly use React.js, which I began learning in early 2014. 
While I specialize in the frontend, I spend a good chunk of my time writing server code. 
Most of my open-source work is JS library development. 
I work well in a team environment or alone unsupervised as required. 
I am experienced in delivering complex projects within short timelines. 
I always meet my deadlines. 
If you need someone to bounce your ideas off of in order to develop the best approach, I can help there.
My experience over the last years includes working on over 100 successful projects with small and medium-sized companies. 
I can assist in a variety of environments. 
If you need a Project Lead, I am able to deliver at that level as well. 
I am a Renaissance Web Developer. 
Whatever you need in web development, I can deliver it. Thank you.
